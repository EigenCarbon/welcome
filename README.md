# üå± Eigen Carbon

**Mint Land and Sea üåä. Burn üî• coins for ESG ‚ôªÔ∏è.**

Eigen Carbon is a decentralized protocol that turns parcels of the ocean, Indigenous and other lands into verified carbon credits using ERC-721 NFTs and ERC-20 tokens. We bring carbon on-chain ‚Äî with transparent proof, verifiable science, and real utility for ESG-conscious businesses and individuals. Eigen Carbon aligns with major accounting standards IFRS and US GAAP to assist carbon emitters in avoiding asset impairment, meeting environmental obligations, and satisfying stakeholder expectations.

## ‚ú® TL;DR

Eigen Carbon is a decentralized climate protocol that lets ocean and land custodians mint NFTs for carbon-sequestering parcels. After verification, they can mint carbon coins (ERC-20s, e.g., `CC2025`) that expire each year. Businesses burn these tokens to meet ESG goals and accounting standards, with on-chain proof and auditor-grade documentation.

---

## üåä The Vision

Global climate markets are opaque, fragmented, and full of unverifiable claims. Eigen Carbon fixes that by introducing a transparent, crypto-native carbon credit system that leverages:

- **ERC-721 NFTs to represent sea and land parcels**
- **ERC-20 tokens to represent carbon credits (e.g., `CC2025`, `CC2026`)**
- **NFT land/sea parcel verification combined with separate carbon verification**
- **Risk mitigation and accounting standard compatibility using a Vintage Coin concept**
- **Proof-of-burn to verify carbon offset claims**
- **IPFS and block explorers for complete auditability**
- **Respect and inclusion for Native Title Holders and other Indigenous groups**

We're creating a future where climate accountability is open-source, programmable, and unstoppable.

## üîß How It Works

### 1. **Land & Sea NFT Minting With Verification**

Users mint NFTs that represent unique parcels of land and sea. Each NFT includes:

* Geographic coordinates using multiple spatial systems including lat/lon, GeoJSON, S2, H3, and ~40 others
* Estimated annual carbon sequestration (e.g., expressed as kg CO‚ÇÇ per annum)
* Jurisdictional metadata
* Title information
* A separate verification contract to ensure the integrity of the NFT.

### 2. **Carbon Verification**

Independent carbon verifiers confirm the carbon sequestration potential of each parcel, enabling it to be used in carbon issuance.

### 3. **Carbon Coin Minting**

After verification, the NFT owner can mint ERC-20 tokens (e.g., `CC2025`, `CC2026`) that represent 1 kg of captured carbon per token. These tokens:

- Include metadata for **vintage year** (e.g., 2025, 2026)
- Expire on **June 30** of their vintage year to ensure market integrity
- Can be held, traded (e.g., via Uniswap), or burned

### 4. **Burn & Abate**

When a token is burned:

* A **proof-of-burn receipt** is issued and stored on IPFS
* A **PDF ESG certificate** is optionally generated with token ID, date/time, wallet, vintage, abatement and jurisdiction
* The burn is publicly recorded on-chain

The party that burns the carbon coin is the party that can claim the carbon abatement.

## üíº Accounting & Financial Statement Benefits

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Preventing Asset Write-Downs

Polluting assets‚Äîsuch as power plants, industrial facilities, or mines‚Äîrisk impairment due to environmental liabilities. Accounting standards such as **IAS 36** (Impairment of Assets) and **US GAAP ASC 360** require that future expected costs (e.g., for carbon compliance) be considered when valuing such assets.

Burning **vintage carbon coins before June 30** can:

- Demonstrate that a company is **actively mitigating environmental risk**
- Reduce the **estimated cost of future compliance**
- Help support the asset's **recoverable amount**
- **Avoid triggering an impairment loss**

### üìú How This Helps Under IFRS and US GAAP

- Under **IAS 36**, environmental obligations that reduce asset value must be accounted for. Offsetting emissions with dated, verifiable carbon coins **reduces projected liabilities**, helping preserve asset value.
- Under **US GAAP**, if an asset's future cash flows are impacted by carbon taxes or regulation, companies must test for impairment. Having verifiable offset mechanisms with **token burn receipts** and **certificates** can **bolster the recoverability test**.

### üîç Why Auditors and Accountants Trust Eigen Carbon

Eigen Carbon provides a robust framework for financial and ESG reporting:

1. **Objective Benchmarking** ‚Äì Carbon coins trade in open markets like Uniswap, giving auditors a liquid, market-based valuation benchmark for impairment testing and asset provisioning.
2. **Transparent Audit Trail** ‚Äì All transactions, including minting, transfers, and burns, are recorded on-chain, ensuring full traceability and immutability.
3. **Cryptographic Proof of Retirement** ‚Äì When a polluter retires (burns) a vintage of carbon coins, the action is logged with cryptographic signatures and timestamped metadata, forming verifiable proof of environmental responsibility.

This enables carbon emitters and their auditors to confidently certify ESG efforts and comply with both IFRS (IAS 36) and US GAAP impairment disclosure standards.

## üåç Indigenous Engagement and Ethical Design

Eigen Carbon has been designed with Indigenous peoples front of mind.

Indigenous communities manage approximately **25% of the Earth's surface**, and in Australia, they care for around **46% of the land**. These custodians are actively protecting ecosystems, rewilding areas, and absorbing atmospheric carbon ‚Äî **yet rarely receive compensation** for these vital services.

We have conducted extensive consultations to ensure **respectful, equitable, and non-exploitative inclusion**. Our approach consciously avoids repeating historical injustices, such as the so-called "Batman Treaty" of 1835 in Australia, where over 600,000 acres of land around present-day Melbourne were claimed by a private settler in exchange for basic goods like blankets, flour, and scissors‚Äîan arrangement neither understood by the Wurundjeri people nor recognized as valid by the British Crown.

To prevent exploitation, **carbon coins are minted by vintage** ‚Äî they **expire after 12 months**, ensuring no long-term rights are unknowingly given away. Custodians retain sovereignty and can choose whether to verify and mint credits annually, keeping control in their hands. This also creates accounting certainty.

By creating a **verifiable and cryptographically secure mechanism**, Eigen Carbon provides a **fair pathway for Indigenous custodians to be rewarded** for their role in abating the world's carbon ‚Äî without compromising land ownership or cultural integrity.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Respecting Sovereignty, Culture, and Land Stewardship

Most government-backed carbon offset schemes require land custodians to permanently change how they use the land ‚Äî such as prohibiting grazing, harvesting, or traditional burning. These mandates are often rooted in colonial assumptions that ignore or override Indigenous knowledge systems, and they can strip Indigenous communities of agency and traditional land practices.

Eigen Carbon was designed differently. We do not require land use changes. Instead, we recognize and reward the existing, proven carbon stewardship of land and sea custodians ‚Äî particularly Indigenous peoples who care for 25% of Earth‚Äôs surface and contribute disproportionately to biodiversity protection and carbon abatement. By using vintage-based carbon coins that expire after 12 months, we avoid exploitative permanent agreements and allow for flexibility, fairness, and future negotiation.

Eigen Carbon ensures land custodians are respected, compensated, and empowered ‚Äî not dispossessed.

## üåø Incentives for Land and Sea Custodians

Eigen Carbon is designed to align long-term environmental stewardship with direct economic rewards. Custodians of land and ocean parcels ‚Äî whether they be individuals, NGOs, Indigenous people or sovereign entities ‚Äî are incentivized to increase the carbon sequestration potential of their assets.

By improving the carbon abatement capability of a parcel (e.g., planting trees, restoring mangroves, rewilding landscapes, or deploying ocean-based carbon capture systems), custodians can:

- Qualify for more carbon tokens per year
- Increase the verified yield of their parcel
- Access greater revenue through token sales or ESG partnerships

These incentives create a virtuous cycle where ecological improvement is both measurable and financially rewarding, ultimately scaling global climate impact.

## üîó Service‚ÄìVerifier Architecture

Eigen Carbon follows a modular Service‚ÄìVerifier model. Each environmental service (e.g., BiodiversityService, CarbonService, WaterQualityService) attaches to the LandNFT, representing a specific parcel of land or ocean. These services are responsible for issuing credits, tokens, or attestations based on verifications. Each service maintains a panel of approved verifiers ‚Äî either individuals, institutions, or decentralized oracles ‚Äî who apply their own methodologies to assess the relevant claims. This design enables layered verification across multiple domains while ensuring that every credit is anchored to a verifiable piece of land through the NFT registry.

---

## üßæ Open Verification Model

Eigen Carbon is built around an open and extensible verification model. We recognize that different jurisdictions and stakeholders rely on varied forms of land title verification ‚Äî from Torrens Title systems to anthropological or customary tenure and storytelling methods. Similarly, carbon verification can encompass a wide range of techniques including soil sampling, remote sensing, drone-based multispectral imaging, and third-party scientific audits. Our framework is designed to accommodate diverse approaches to crypto-economic security and validation, empowering local communities, scientists, landholders, and independent verifiers to participate on equal footing. This pluralism is central to Eigen Carbon‚Äôs mission: enabling a credible, inclusive, and transparent carbon market.
